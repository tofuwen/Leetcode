又是一道不会做的题・・・


In first loop, make all numbers less than 1 and greater than n equal to n+1.

Now in array, we will have value either between 1 and n or n+1. In second loop, if value is equal to n+1 simply continue. If it is between 1 and n, then make value at that index negative.

In third loop, if you get any value positive then return that_index+1 and if no value is positive, return n+1.


So brilliant!!

思路就是用数组的index表示某种信息！！！！

所以要求值的范围就是 1 - n, 跟数组个数对应！！

看到老多题目用到这个trick了・・・
