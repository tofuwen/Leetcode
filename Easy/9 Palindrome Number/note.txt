This problem is meanless

Impossible to solve without extra space. 
Always need space for constants, variables or whatever. 
Recursion calls will take space for call stack.

If you are talking about constant space, then even declaring a string / stack will take constant space. 
(In fact at most (log(10, INT_MAX) * sizeof char), which is no worse than declaring an integer or more). 
Actually, even recursion will take constant space.
